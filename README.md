# Mech-Eye Interface
Official C++ interface for Mech-Eye cameras.

## Installation

This part tells you how to configure and run project on Windows.

#### Prerequisites

In Order to use this interface you will need the following Prerequisites installed:
1. [Cmake](https://cmake.org/) -Version > 3.7 is required.
2. [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) -Version > 2015 is recommended.
#### Using CMake to configure 



1. Clone the project and select project folder in Cmake. Select where you want to build.

   ![step1](./img/step1.jpg)

2. Click the configure and choose the compiler(Visual Studio).

   ![step2_2](./img/step2_2.jpg)

3. Extract files from **\Mech-Eye_interface\dependencies\dependencies for MechEye_OpenInterface.7z** and modify the path in the cmake according to the locations of these extracted files.

   ![step3](./img/step3.jpg)

4. Click **Generate** and then **Open Project** and project will be opened in Visual Studio.

5. Add all extrated .dll files in Step 3 to System Path.

## Quick Start

Open the Visual Studio.

Modify the IP address according to the actual address in every sample_xxx.cpp files and build it.

![ip](./img/ip.jpg)

Then VS will generate an exe file, usually **.\build\Debug\MechEye_OpenInterface.exe**.

Run this program and it will capture pictures and point clouds in the folder **D:/test/**.

* **dependencies**

  It contains all .dll and other dependencies needed by the project.

* **include**

  It contains all .h header files of interfaces.

* **proto**

  It contains files generated by Google protobuf. It defines data structure of communication between interfaces and camera over the networks.

* **sample**

  It contains 2 samples which briefly introduce the usage of interfaces.

* **src**

  It contains all source code, interface fucntions are defined in CameraClient.cpp. Main.cpp, sample1_parameter.cpp and sample2_ImgAndCloud are examples to show how to use interfaces.

## Brief Intro to interfaces

All interfaces and functions are in  **CameraClient.cpp**.

There are two main classes: CameraClient and ZmqClient. CameraClient is subclass of ZmqClient. You only need to focus on CameraClient.

* **CameraClient**

  * **connect()** : connect to the camera according to its ip address.

  * **captureDepthImg()** : capture a depth image and return it.

  * **captureColorImg()** : capture a color image and return it.

  * **getCameraIntri()**: get camera's intrinsic parameters.

  * **getCameraIp()**: get camera's ip address.

  * **getCameraVersion()**: get camera's version number.

  * **getParameter()** : get the value of a specific parameter in camera.

  * **setParameter()** : set the value of a specific parameter in camera.

    **Note**：Some parameters cannot be set in this version, they are available in next version. But they can still be set in Mech_eye. Here are all parameters can be set now(You can check them in Mech_eye software):

    * **Projection** part:
      * period
      * isNanoType
      * syncExposure
    * **3D scaning** part:
      * exposure1
      * exposure2
      * exposure3
      * gain
      * useBinning
      * useColorHdr
    * **2D scaning** part:
      * camera2DExpTime
      * expectedGrayValue
      * sharpenfactor
    * **filter** part:
      * contrastThres
      * strength
      * useMedianBlur
      * hasThinObject
    * **depth limit** part:
      * lowerLimit
      * upperLimit

  * **captureRgbPointCloud()** : get a point cloud as pcl::PointXYZRGB


### Intro to samples

The original project provides 2 samples to show how to use interfaces. They are included under **.\sample**.

##### sample1_parameter.cpp

This sample mainly shows how to set camera's paramters like exposure time.

First, we need to know the actual ip address of camera and set it, and then connect:

```c++
CameraClient camera;
std::string error;
// Camera ip should be modified to actual ip address.
const std::string cameraIp = "192.168.3.146";
if (!camera.connect(cameraIp)) return -1; //return -1 if connection to camera fails

```

Then, we can get some brief info about camera:

```c++
std::cout << "Camera IP: " << camera.getCameraIp() << std::endl
		<< "Camera ID: " << camera.getCameraId() << std::endl
		<< "Version: " << camera.getCameraVersion() << std::endl; //get and print some information about camera device
```

Finally, we can set and get the value of a specific parameter, in this case, we choose exposure time for color image:

```c++
std::cout<<camera.setParamater(“camera2DExposureTime”, 10)<<std::endl;
//unit for exposure time is ms, return value of setParameter is string.If successful, the return string will be empty, otherwise it prints error message.
std::cout<<camera.getParameter(“camera2DExposureTime”, error)<<std::endl;

```

##### sample2_ImgAndCloud.cpp

After connected to the camera, the program can capture color images and depth images by camera, and also point clouds. We use PCL to store and process point clouds.
