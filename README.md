# Mech-Eye Interface
Official C++ interface for Mech-Eye cameras.

## Installation

This part tells you how to configure and run project on Windows.

#### Prerequisites

In Order to use this interface you will need the following Prerequisites installed:
1. [Cmake](https://cmake.org/) -Version > 3.7 is required.
2. [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) -Version > 2015 is recommended.
#### Using CMake to configure 



1. Clone the project and select project folder in Cmake. Select where you want to build.

   ![step1](./docs/step1.jpg)

2. Click the configure and choose the compiler(Visual Studio).

   ![step2_2](./docs/step2_2.jpg)

3. Extract files from **\Mech-Eye_interface\dependencies\dependencies for MechEye_OpenInterface.7z** and modify the path in the cmake according to the locations of these extracted files.

   ![step3](./docs/step3.jpg)

4. Click **Open Project** and project will be opened in Visual Studio.

5. Add all extrated .dll files in Step 3 to System Path.

## Quick Start

Open the Visual Studio.

Modify the ip addr according to in every sample_xxx.cpp files and build it.

![ip](./docs/ip.jpg)

Then VS will generate an exe file, usually **.\build\Debug\MechEye_OpenInterface.exe**.

Run this program and it will capture pictures and point clouds in the folder **D:/test/**.

* **dependencies**

  It contains all .dll dependencies needed by the project.

* **include**

  It contains all .h header files of this interface.

* **proto**

  It contains files generated by Google protobuf. It defines data structure of communication between interface and camera over the networks.

* **src**

  It contains all source code, interface fucntions are defined in CameraClient.cpp. main.cpp and sample_xxx.cpp  are examples to show how to use interfaces.

## Brief Intro to interfaces

All you interfaces and functions are in  **CameraClient.cpp**.

There are two main classes: CameraClient and ZmqClient. CameraClient is subclass of ZmqClient. You only need to focus on CameraClient.

* **CameraClient**

  * **connect()** : connect to the camera according to its ip address.
  * **captureDepthImg()** : capture a depth image and return it.
  * **captureColorImg()** : capture a color image and return it.
  * **getCameraIntri()**: get camera's intrinsics.
  * **getCameraIp()**: get camera's ip address.
  * **getCameraVersion()**: get camera's version number.
  * **getParameter()** : get the value of a spefic parameter in camera.
  * **setParameter()** : set the value of a spefic parameter in camera.
  * **captureRgbPointCloud()** : get a point cloud as pcl::PointXYZRGB


### Intro to samples

The original project provides 2 samples to show how to use APIs. They are included under **.\sample**.

##### sample1_parameter.cpp

This sample mainly shows how to set camera's paramters like exporeture time.

First, we need to know the actual ip address of camera and set it, and then connect to it:

```c++
CameraClient camera;
std::string error;
// Camera ip should be modified to actual ip address.
const std::string cameraIp = "192.168.3.146";
if (!camera.connect(cameraIp)) return -1; //return -1 if connection to camera fails

```

Then, we can get some brief info about camera:

```c++
std::cout << "Camera IP: " << camera.getCameraIp() << std::endl
		<< "Camera ID: " << camera.getCameraId() << std::endl
		<< "Version: " << camera.getCameraVersion() << std::endl; //get and print some information about camera device
```

Finally, we can set and get the value of a specific parameter, in this case, we choose exposure time for color image:

```c++
std::cout<<camera.setParamater(para, 10)<<std::endl;
//unit for exposure time is ms, return value of setParameter is string.If successful, the return string will be empty, otherwise it prints error message.
std::cout<<camera.getParameter(para, error)<<std::endl;

```

##### sample2_ImgAndCloud.cpp

After connected to the camera, the program can capture color images and depth images by camera. And also point clouds. We use PCL to store and process point clouds.
